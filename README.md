### [amqAutoSkipIncorrectAnswers.user.js](https://github.com/Onetel2/amq_scripts/blob/main/amqNoAutoSkipIncorrectAnswers)
- It prevents AMQ from automatically skipping the song during the Replay Phase if every player answers incorrectly.
- Requires the Auto Skip Vote (Replay Phase) feature to be turned on under AMQ's general game settings.
- You can still skip the song by clicking the skip button manually.
- You can toggle the script on with [SHIFT] + [Alt] + [C]. Script is off by default.
- Useful to learn new songs while still skipping already known songs.
